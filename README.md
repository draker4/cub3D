# cub3D
11th 42 school's project.
As the so_long called project, cub3D is a minigame using the minilibx graphics library. So_long was a 2D platform game, but cub3D uses ray-tracing to move in a 3D environment as the first Wolfenstein 3D game.
This project uses the linux minilibx (so_long was on the MacOs one), the player can move in all directions, punch and shoot ennemies, open and close doors. It is possible to move the camera, some sprites are added for decoration, moving ennemies or actions, and collisions are of course coded for both walls and sprites.
